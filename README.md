NeoVim IDE from Scratch

## Install Neovim

You can install Neovim with your package manager e.g. brew, apt, pacman etc.. bus remember that when you update your packages Neovim may be upgraded to a newer version.

If you would like to make sure Neovim only updates when you want it to than I recommend installing from source: [instructions](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim#install-from-source)

## Install the config

```shell
git clone https://github.com/z-elaine/nvim-recipe.git ~/.config/nvim
```
